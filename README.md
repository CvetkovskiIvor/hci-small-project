The aim of the experiment was to compare the workload caused by two different interaction modalities in a virtual reality 
(VR) system. In the first modality, interactive elements in a VR application are accessed via a hand controller, while in 
the second modality, a virtual beam projected according to the position of the headset is used for this purpose. Twenty 
users participated in the experiment, performing the given task set with both modalities (with corresponding counterbalancing 
in determining the order). After performing representative tasks with the given modalities, participants completed the 
standardized NASA TLX questionnaire (the so-called "raw" version), in which they directly compared five selected TLX factors 
on semantic differential scales with 21 levels. The TLX factor scores for each modality tested, according to each user's 
rating, are available in an Excel file.
Perform a statistical analysis of the available data and draw appropriate conclusions.
